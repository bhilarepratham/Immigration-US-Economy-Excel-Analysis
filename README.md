# Immigration and the US Economy: A Comprehensive Statistical Analysis (1980-2021)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a **data-driven statistical analysis** examining the relationship between **immigration and key U.S. macroeconomic indicators** over a 42-year period (1980–2021). The analysis was conducted **entirely in Microsoft Excel**, leveraging built-in analytical tools to derive evidence-based insights relevant to economics, policy, and business decision-making.

The study evaluates whether immigration has a statistically significant impact on:

* GDP Growth
* Unemployment Rate
* Personal Income Growth

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Microsoft Excel**

  * Data Analysis ToolPak (Regression)
  * Pivot Tables
  * Correlation Matrices
  * Time-Series Charts
  * Residual & Diagnostic Analysis

> No programming languages or scripts were used. All data processing, modeling, and visualization were performed in Excel.

## 📂 Data Sources

* **U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)** – Immigration Statistics
* **Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)** – GDP & Personal Income
* **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)** – Unemployment Rate
* **Kaggle** – Consolidated historical immigration datasets

All datasets were harmonized to **annual frequency** and merged using year as the primary key.

## 🔄 Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Integration**

   * Combined 42 years of immigration, economic, and labor market data (1980–2021)

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Handled missing values in growth and lagged variables
   * Verified data integrity and removed duplicates
   * Identified and documented outliers (e.g., 2008–09 recession, COVID-19)

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Net Immigration
   * GDP Growth Rate
   * Personal Income Growth
   * Lagged Immigration & GDP variables

4. **Statistical Analysis**

   * Correlation analysis to identify linear relationships
   * Time-series visualization of long-term trends
   * Multiple Linear Regression using Excel’s Data Analysis ToolPak

5. **Model Validation**

   * Train–Test Split:

     * Training: 1980–2015
     * Testing: 2016–2021
   * Evaluated using R-squared, p-values, residual plots, and MAPE

## 📊 Models Built

| Model   | Dependent Variable     | Purpose                                          |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Model 1 | GDP Growth Rate        | Measure impact of immigration on economic growth |
| Model 2 | Unemployment Rate      | Test labor market effects of immigration         |
| Model 3 | Personal Income Growth | Analyze income-level implications                |

## 🔍 Key Findings

* Immigration was **not a statistically significant predictor** in any of the three models
* GDP and labor-market fundamentals were the **primary drivers** of economic performance
* Economic cycles (recessions, recoveries) showed **little direct correlation** with immigration flows
* Results align with existing economic literature on the limited short-run macroeconomic effects of immigration
